        "correctAnswer": 4,
        "explanationText": "The passage mentions that ragwort's impact on New Zealand's agriculture wasespecially severe because the plant's proliferation \"coincided with sweeping changesin agriculture that saw a massive shift from sheep farming to dairying.\" The severity ofthe impact was increased because cattle, which were displacing sheep, are much moresensitive than sheep to the toxins contained in ragwort. This points to Choice E as the correct answer choice. Nothing in the passage suggests that the proliferation of ragwortcoincided with a dec  in agriculture (Choice A), occurred faster than it might havedone (Choice B), or made the plants more toxic (Choice C). There is a suggestion thatragwort honey might not be safe for humans, but there is no indication that this madethe timing of the proliferation particularly unfortunate.35For the following question, consider each of the choices separately and selectall that apply.",

B Catering establishments know how many people they expect to serve, and therefore are less likely than restaurants to have, and serve, leftover food, a major source of food poisoning.", "Many restaurants provide catering services for banquets in addition to serving individual meals.", "The number of reported food-poisoning cases at catered banquets is unrelated to whether the meal is served on the caterer's or the client's premises.", "People are unlikely to make a connection between a meal they have eaten and a subsequent illness unless the illness strikes a group who are in communication with one another."],

        "explanationText": "The question calls for an explanation of why more cases of reported food poisoningmight be attributed to catering services than to restaurants. Choices A and B bothprovide reasons why restaurants should account for more cases, so they are incorrect.Choice C would suggest that there would be negligible differences between thelikelihood of food poisoning at restaurants and at catered events, so it also sheds nolight on the paradox and is therefore incorrect. Since the argument does not pertain tothe location of catered banquets, Choice D is incorrect. That leaves Choice E. Peoplewho attend banquets are more likely than restaurant patrons to be part of a group thatcommunicates with one another, so Choice E would help explain the higher number ofreported food poisonings and is the correct answer.",

        "explanationText": "Choice C is correct. The question asks about the consequences of more advertising inAfrican American newspapers.Choice A is incorrect: The passage states that publishers of African Americannewspapers felt compelled to publish sports and society news even without any pressurefrom advertisers, so advertising revenue was not a factor in their editorial decisions.Choice B is incorrect: The passage says that lack of advertising revenue madeAfrican American newspapers more expensive than the large national dailies, implyingthat if advertisers had purchased space, the difference in price would have beensmaller; but nothing in the passage supports the claim that African Americannewspapers would have been cheaper than the large national dailies.Choice C is correct: The passage states that large newspapers could not readilyprint politically charged material because they \"depended on advertisers' ideologicalapproval to secure revenues,\" so it can be expected that African American newspaperswould have experienced similar constraints if they also had depended on advertisersfor revenues.",

        "explanationText": "The second sentence of the passage states that \"knowing that buyers of AfricanAmerican newspapers also bought general-circulation papers, advertisers of consumerproducts often ignored African American publications.\" This suggests that advertisersbelieved that the majority of the people who read African American newspapers wouldsee the advertisements when they read general-circulation papers, and that the numberof people who read only African American newspapers was too small to justify buyingadvertising space there.

He must believe,then, that the water currently rises to the surface more quickly. As for Choice B, whilethe passage indeed states that deep waters in Antarctica store heat, it also suggests thatthis heat would be less likely to reach the surface and worsen global warming.

        "explanationText": "The passage compares sales of items in the sunlit part of the store with sales of itemsin the artificially lit part of the store and concludes that since the former are greaterthan the latter, the presence of sunlight increases sales. The assumption underlying thisargument is that the only significant difference between the two parts of the store is thepresence of sunlight--otherwise, the inherent popularity of goods sold in differentlocations, or some other factor, might account for the increased sales. Choice B helpsrule out the possibility that other factors might be involved, by showing that sales areno greater when the sunlight is taken out of the equation. Therefore it is the correct answer. Choices D and E both suggest that factors besides sunlight might explain thediscrepancy between sales; therefore they weaken rather than strengthen theargument, and so are incorrect. Neither Choice A nor Choice C point to differencesbetween the two areas of the store; therefore they are both incorrect as well.",
