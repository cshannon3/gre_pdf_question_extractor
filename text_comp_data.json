        "explanationText": "The second sentence asserts that clouds make for warmer nights by doing something to theloss of heat from Earth. Since less heat lost means more warmth, a word that meanspreventing or slowing heat loss is required for Blank (i). \"Inhibiting\" is therefore the answer.\"Exacerbating\" has the opposite meaning, while \"replicating\" makes no sense in thiscontext. Since the first sentence asserts that daytime highs are increasing less rapidly thannighttime lows, Blank (ii) calls for a verb that indicates a moderation in rises in temperatureduring the day, and \"restrain\" has this sense. \"Augment,\" meaning to increase, has theopposite meaning, while \"mask\" would indicate that measurements are not reflecting actualincreases in temperature, an idea not supported by the rest of the passage. The \"because\"in the last sentence indicates that the second clause explains how daytime temperatureincreases are restrained; it does so by making reference to solar energy and the evaporationof moisture. Because solar energy is responsible for increases in daytime temperature, theanswer to Blank (iii) requires a word that explains how evaporation can lessen or divertthat energy for other purposes. \"Used up in\" does this because it indicates that less solarenergy is available to warm the Earth's surface when a portion of it is instead devoted toevaporation. Neither \"intensified by\" nor \"unrelated to\" indicate a connection between solarenergy and evaporation that would lessen warming.Thus the correct answer is inhibiting (Choice A), restrain (Choice F), and used upin (Choice I).74Question Type 2: Text CompletionFor each of Questions 1 to 8, select one entry for each blank from the correspondingcolumn of choices.

Of thechoices for Blank (i), \"ignore\" is the only choice that conveys this sentiment; \"promote\"connotes the opposite, while \"reinterpret\" suggests a different sort of positive engagementwith classical music that is otherwise unmentioned in the passage.

        "explanationText": "The sentence discusses a purported change in how popular culture and high art arerelatively valued; the author is scrutinizing the notion that the academic study of theformer has significantly raised its once lowly status. In the last sentence, Blank (iii) ispreceded by the word \"continued,\" indicating that something about intellectuals' view ofthe hierarchy of culture has remained unchanged. Since the author states in the firstsentence that this hierarchy was once dominant, \"investment in\" the hierarchy would in-dicate that sense of continuity. Neither of the other two options is supported by the pas-sage because there is no indication the author believes that intellectuals have along-held aversion to or misunderstanding of that hierarchy. The \"although\" that beginsthe last sentence indicates that the phrase completed by Blank (ii) will contrast therespectability of analyses of popular culture with something that nonetheless reveals acontinued allegiance to the hierarchy. A need to explain away a \"distaste for\" or an\"indifference to\" action movies or pulp fiction would not indicate any such allegiance,so those choices must be incorrect. However, a need to justify one's penchant or likingfor popular culture would indicate an adherence to the high-low culture hierarchy. Thus\"penchant for\" is the correct choice for Blank (ii). Finally, since the author is suggestingthat the hierarchy given to high and low culture is not obsolete as some claim, it followsthat the shift in attitudes is exaggerated; thus, the correct answer to Blank (i) is\"overstated.\" \"Underappreciated\" implies the opposite, and \"counterproductive\" implies ajudgment about the value of the hierarchy, whereas the passage is primarily concernedwith its existence.Thus the correct answer is overstated (Choice C), penchant for (Choice D), andinvestment in (Choice H).78",
